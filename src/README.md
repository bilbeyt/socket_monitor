# Socket Monitor Technical Reference

## Introduction

This app is tracking Sealed and PacketProposed events on 
[Socket contracts](https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socket-DL/blob/master/contracts/socket/Socket.sol).

If it detects a data mismatch sends a [trip transaction](https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socket-DL/blob/master/contracts/switchboard/default-switchboards/SwitchboardBase.sol#L232) 
on switchboard contract indicated on PacketProposed event.

## Architecture

This app has 3 main components to mention:

### EventFetcher

Main component to handle fetching Sealed and PacketProposed events. It automatically adapts the speed according to event fetching times, and if rpc is limiting the log size it reacts to that.
Also, it can be configured against reorgs that might occur.

### EventMonitor

This component is using EventFetcher and creating a bridge to event handler component EventProcessor. Every chain has its own EventMonitor.

It is notifying 3 things:
1. New events
2. Sync done
3. Rpc status changes

### EventProcessor

This component is handling events came from EventMonitors. There is only 1 EventProcessor as by looking at the PacketProposed event we can not detect the source chain.

It starts operating events after chains are synced, and enables/disables the chain using EventMonitors.

#### Detection algorithm

It is matching Sealed event `packetId`, `root` and `transmitter` with PacketProposed event. If there is a mismatch, it sends trip transaction.
If there is a problem sending the trip transaction, it is trying to send it.
